    - Step angles typically range from 0.9 to 90 degrees depending on the motor design
- **Operation Modes**
    - Full step: One phase energized at a time
    - Half step: Alternates between one and two phases energized
    - Microstepping: Current is controlled to achieve smaller step angles
- **Open-Loop Control**

    - The semiconductor material typically uses cadmium sulfide (CdS) or cadmium selenide (CdSe)
    - Packaged in a disk shape with conductive traces forming a zigzag pattern across the surface
- **Operating Principle**
    - The resistance of an LDR varies inversely with the intensity of light falling on it
    - In darkness, an LDR has very high resistance (several megaohms)
    - In bright light, the resistance drops significantly (few hundred ohms)
- **Physical Mechanism**
    - When light falls on the semiconductor material, photons are absorbed by the material
    - The absorbed photons transfer energy to electrons, allowing them to jump into the conduction band
    - More free electrons result in increased conductivity (decreased resistance)
- **Circuit Implementation**
    - Typically used in voltage divider configuration with a fixed resistor
    - The voltage at the junction changes with light intensity
    - This voltage change is measured by an ADC to determine light levels

**Working of PIR Motion Sensor:**

    - PIR (Passive Infrared) sensors consist of a pyroelectric sensor element, Fresnel lens, and processing circuitry
    - The pyroelectric sensor detects infrared radiation in its field of view
    - The Fresnel lens focuses infrared radiation onto the sensor element
- **Detection Principle**
    - All objects emit infrared radiation based on their temperature
    - Human bodies emit infrared radiation around 9.4 micrometers wavelength
    - PIR sensors detect changes in infrared radiation rather than absolute levels
- **Operational Mechanism**
    - The pyroelectric sensor contains two sensing elements connected in reverse
    - When both elements detect the same IR level (no motion), their signals cancel out
    - When an object moves across the field of view, one element detects more IR than the other
- **Motion Detection**
    - The differential signal from the two elements is amplified and triggers detection
    - The sensor only responds to changes in IR levels (motion), not stationary heat sources
    - Most PIR sensors have adjustable sensitivity and time delay settings
- **Applications**
    - Security systems for intrusion detection
    - Automatic lighting control based on occupancy
    - Energy management in buildings and homes
    - Motion-activated consumer devices

## Q.3(a) Develop an Arduino sketch to blink built-in LED. (3 marks)

```arduino
// Arduino sketch to blink built-in LED

void setup() {
  // Initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Turn the LED on
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
  delay(1000);  // Wait for 1 second (1000 milliseconds)

  // Turn the LED off
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
  delay(1000);  // Wait for 1 second
}

```

**Explanation:**

- The `setup()` function runs once when the Arduino starts and configures pin LED_BUILTIN as output
- The `loop()` function runs repeatedly and toggles the LED on and off with 1-second delays
- `LED_BUILTIN` is a constant that refers to the built-in LED (usually on pin 13)
- `digitalWrite(HIGH)` turns the LED on and `digitalWrite(LOW)` turns it off

String receivedString = "";     // String to hold incoming data
boolean stringComplete = false; // Flag for complete string received

void setup() {
  // Initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second
  Serial.begin(9600);

  // Print welcome message
  Serial.println("Enter text to echo:");
}

void loop() {
  // Check if data is available to read from serial port
  while (Serial.available() > 0) {
    // Read the incoming byte
    char inChar = (char)Serial.read();

    // Add character to string if not newline or carriage return
    if (inChar != '\n' && inChar != '\r') {
      receivedString += inChar;
    }
    // If newline, set completion flag
    else if (inChar == '\n') {
      stringComplete = true;
    }
  }

  // If a complete string has been received
  if (stringComplete) {
    // Display the received string
    Serial.print("You entered: ");
    Serial.println(receivedString);

    // Clear the string and reset flag for next input
    receivedString = "";
    stringComplete = false;

    // Prompt for more input
    Serial.println("Enter more text (or reset to start over):");
  }
}

```

**Explanation:**

- The sketch initializes serial communication at 9600 baud in the `setup()` function
- `Serial.begin(9600)` establishes serial communication between Arduino and computer
- A welcome message is displayed to prompt the user for input
- The `loop()` function continuously checks for available serial data using `Serial.available()`
- Characters are read one by one using `Serial.read()` and added to the `receivedString`
- When a newline character is detected, the `stringComplete` flag is set
- When a complete string is received, it's displayed back with "You entered: " prefix
- The string and flag are reset to prepare for the next input
- This process continues indefinitely as the loop repeats

## Q.3(a) OR: Develop an Arduino sketch to print 1 to 10 numbers using loop() function. (3 marks)

```arduino
// Arduino sketch to print 1 to 10 numbers using loop() function

void setup() {
  // Initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second
  Serial.begin(9600);

  // Print a message to indicate the start
  Serial.println("Printing numbers 1 to 10:");
}

void loop() {
  // For loop to print numbers 1 to 10
  for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    Serial.println(i);
    delay(500);  // Add a delay of 500ms between numbers
  }

  // Print a message after completing the sequence
  Serial.println("Sequence completed!");

  // Add a longer delay before repeating
  delay(3000);
}

```

**Explanation:**

- The `setup()` function initializes serial communication at 9600 baud
- In the `loop()` function, a for loop counts from 1 to 10
- Each number is printed to the serial monitor with `Serial.println()`
- A 500ms delay is added between numbers for readability
- After printing all numbers, a completion message is displayed
- A 3-second delay is added before the sequence repeats

```arduino
// Arduino sketch to check if character is digit or alphabet
// and determine case if it's an alphabet

char testCharacter;  // Character to be tested

void setup() {
  // Initialize serial communication
  Serial.begin(9600);

      Serial.println("The character is a digit.");
    }
    // Check if character is an alphabet
    else if (isAlpha(testCharacter)) {
      Serial.println("The character is an alphabet.");

      // Check if character is uppercase
      if (isUpperCase(testCharacter)) {
        Serial.println("It is in UPPER case.");
      }
      // Check if character is lowercase
      else if (isLowerCase(testCharacter)) {
        Serial.println("It is in lower case.");
      }
    }
    // Character is neither digit nor alphabet
    else {
      Serial.println("The character is a special character.");
    }

    // Prompt for another character
    Serial.println("\nEnter another character to check:");
  }
}

```

**Explanation:**

- The sketch initializes serial communication in the `setup()` function
- In the `loop()` function, it checks for available serial data
- When a character is entered, it's stored in the `testCharacter` variable
- The sketch ignores newline and carriage return characters
- It uses Arduino's character classification functions:

## Q.4(c) OR: Explain working of CoAP in detail. (7 marks)

**Working of CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol):**

1. **Protocol Overview**
    - CoAP is a specialized web transfer protocol for constrained devices and networks
    - Designed for machine-to-machine (M2M) applications in IoT environments
    - Based on REST architecture similar to HTTP but optimized for constrained environments
    - Uses UDP as the transport layer protocol instead of TCP to reduce overhead
    - Binary format instead of text to reduce transmission size
2. **Architecture Model**
    - Client-server model similar to HTTP
    - Supports both synchronous and asynchronous message exchanges
    - Implements a subset of HTTP functionality (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
    - Uses URI format for resource identification
    - Supports multicast addressing for one-to-many communication
3. **Message Format**
    - Compact binary header (4 bytes) followed by optional Token, Options, and Payload
    - Header includes Version, Type, Token Length, Code, and Message ID fields
    - Four message types: Confirmable (CON), Non-confirmable (NON), Acknowledgement (ACK), Reset (RST)
    - Response codes similar to HTTP (2.xx for success, 4.xx for client errors, etc.)
4. **Request-Response Model**
    - **Confirmable Messages (CON)**: Require acknowledgment from receiver
    - **Non-confirmable Messages (NON)**: "Fire and forget" messages without acknowledgment
    - **Piggyback Responses**: Response carried directly in the acknowledgment message
    - **Separate Responses**: When immediate response is not possible, server sends ACK first, then response later
5. **Reliability Mechanism**
    - Confirmable messages are retransmitted if acknowledgment not received
    - Default timeout is adjustable and uses exponential back-off
    - Message IDs prevent duplicate processing of retransmitted messages
    - Reset (RST) messages indicate recipient couldn't process the message
6. **Observation Model**
    - Allows clients to "observe" resources (subscribe to changes)
    - Server notifies clients when observed resource state changes
    - Reduces polling overhead in resource-constrained environments
    - Clients can stop observation by sending RST or explicit cancellation
7. **Block-wise Transfer**
    - Enables transmission of large payloads in smaller chunks
    - Each block can be individually acknowledged
    - Prevents fragmentation at lower layers
    - Supports flow control in constrained networks

## Q.5(a) Explain following I/O functions: digitalRead() and pinMode(). (3 marks)

**digitalRead() Function:**

- Used to read the state (HIGH or LOW) of a specified digital pin on the Arduino
- Returns either HIGH (1) or LOW (0) depending on the voltage detected on the pin
- Syntax: `digitalRead(pin)` where 'pin' is the digital pin number to read
- Used commonly with buttons, switches, and digital sensors to detect their state
- Example: `buttonState = digitalRead(7)` reads the state of pin 7 and stores it in variable buttonState

**pinMode() Function:**

- Used to configure a specific pin on the Arduino to behave as an INPUT, OUTPUT, or INPUT_PULLUP
- Must be called before using a pin for digital I/O operations
- Syntax: `pinMode(pin, mode)` where 'pin' is the pin number and 'mode' is INPUT, OUTPUT, or INPUT_PULLUP
- Sets the pin's internal circuitry to the specified mode
- Example: `pinMode(13, OUTPUT)` configures pin 13 as an output for controlling devices

## Q.5(b) Compare pros and cons of mesh and star topologies in IoT sensor networks. (4 marks)

| Feature | Mesh Topology | Star Topology |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Reliability** | Higher reliability due to multiple path options for data transmission | Lower reliability as failure of central node disrupts entire network |
| **Scalability** | Highly scalable with easy addition of new nodes | Limited scalability based on central node's capacity |
| **Power Consumption** | Higher power consumption in routing nodes that relay data | Lower power consumption for end nodes but high for central node |
| **Range** | Extended range through multi-hop communication | Limited by direct communication range with central node |
| **Complexity** | More complex network management and routing algorithms | Simpler implementation and management |
| **Cost** | Higher initial deployment cost but better coverage | Lower initial cost but may require additional gateways for coverage |
| **Latency** | Variable latency depending on number of hops | Consistent and generally lower latency (single hop) |
| **Bandwidth** | Shared bandwidth that decreases with node density | Dedicated bandwidth between each node and central hub |

## Q.5(a) OR: Explain following serial communication functions: available() and readString(). (3 marks)

**available() Function:**

- Used to determine the number of bytes available to read from the serial port buffer
- Returns an integer representing the number of bytes in the receive buffer
- Returns 0 if no data is available to read
- Commonly used in conditional statements to check if data is available before attempting to read
- Syntax: `Serial.available()` (no parameters required)
- Example: `if (Serial.available() > 0) { // read data }` checks if there's data before reading

**readString() Function:**

- Reads characters from the serial buffer into a String object until timeout occurs
- Default timeout is 1000 milliseconds (1 second)
- Returns a String containing all the characters read
- Stops reading when the buffer is empty (no more data available)
- Useful for collecting an entire string from serial input at once
- Syntax: `Serial.readString()` (no parameters required)
- Example: `inputString = Serial.readString()` reads characters into inputString variable

## Q.5(b) OR: Differentiate between MQTT and CoAP protocols. (4 marks)
