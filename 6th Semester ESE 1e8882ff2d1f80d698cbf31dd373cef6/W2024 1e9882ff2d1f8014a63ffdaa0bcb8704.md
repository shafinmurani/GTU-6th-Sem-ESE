**Working Principle of Ultrasonic Distance Sensor:**

- **Components**: The sensor consists of two main parts - an ultrasonic transmitter (speaker) and a receiver (microphone)
- **Signal Emission**: The transmitter emits high-frequency sound waves (typically 40 kHz) that are beyond human hearing range when triggered
- **Wave Propagation**: These ultrasonic waves travel through the air at approximately 343 meters per second (speed of sound at room temperature)
- **Reflection**: When the sound waves encounter an object, they reflect back toward the sensor as echoes
- **Echo Reception**: The receiver detects these reflected sound waves (echoes) and generates an electrical signal
- **Time Measurement**: The sensor's internal circuitry precisely measures the time elapsed between sending the signal and receiving the echo
- **Distance Calculation**: Distance is calculated using the formula: Distance = (Time × Speed of Sound) ÷ 2
  - The division by 2 accounts for the round-trip travel of the sound (to the object and back)
- **Signal Processing**: The sensor's microcontroller processes this time measurement and converts it to a distance measurement
- **Output Generation**: The sensor outputs this distance measurement as either an analog voltage or a digital signal that can be read by a microcontroller like Arduino

- **Electrical Isolation**: Relays provide physical separation between control circuits and actuator circuits, protecting sensitive microcontrollers from voltage spikes, back EMF, and other electrical issues that can damage them
- **Voltage/Current Amplification**: Relays enable controlling actuators that operate at different voltage levels (e.g., 12V, 24V, 120V AC) than the microcontroller
- **AC/DC Switching**: Relays can switch between alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) circuits, allowing microcontrollers to control both types of actuators
- **Multi-channel Control**: A single microcontroller can control multiple relays to operate several actuators independently

## Q.2(c) State and Explain working principle of servo motors with neat diagram. [7 Marks]

![abc.webp](W2024%201e9882ff2d1f8014a63ffdaa0bcb8704/abc.webp)

**Working Principle of Servo Motors:**

- **Components**: A servo motor consists of a DC motor, a gear assembly, a potentiometer for position feedback, and a control circuit
- **Control Signal**: Servos are controlled by sending Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals, typically ranging from 1-2ms pulses within a 20ms time period
- **Pulse Width Interpretation**: The control circuit interprets the width of the pulse to determine the desired position:
  - ~1ms pulse: Rotate to 0° position (minimum angle)
  - ~1.5ms pulse: Move to center position (90°)
  - ~2ms pulse: Rotate to 180° position (maximum angle)
- **Position Feedback**: The potentiometer is mechanically linked to the output shaft and provides feedback about the current position to the control circuit
- **Error Calculation**: The control circuit compares the desired position (from PWM signal) with the actual position (from potentiometer) to calculate positional error
- **Motor Activation**: Based on the error, the control circuit drives the DC motor in the appropriate direction until the desired position is reached
- **Gear Reduction**: The gear assembly reduces the high speed of the DC motor to increase torque and provide precise positioning capability
- **Holding Torque**: Once the desired position is reached, the servo maintains that position by actively resisting external forces trying to move it
- **Limited Rotation**: Standard servos typically have a limited rotation range (usually 0-180°), though continuous rotation servos are also available

## Q.5(b) Explain Ring topology with its advantage and disadvantage. [4 Marks]

**Ring Topology**:

- A network arrangement where each device is connected to exactly two other devices, forming a closed loop
- Data travels in one direction (unidirectional) or both directions (bidirectional) around the ring
- Each node acts as a repeater, receiving data from one neighbor and transmitting it to the next

**Advantages of Ring Topology**:

- **Performance Under Load**: Maintains consistent performance even under heavy network load due to token passing mechanism
- **Equal Access**: Provides fair access to all devices as each gets an equal opportunity to transmit data when it receives the token
- **Scalability**: Adding devices doesn't significantly impact network performance, allowing for planned expansion
- **Predictable Throughput**: Offers deterministic performance with calculable maximum response times
- **No Collision Issues**: Eliminates data collision problems as only one device transmits at a time
- **Fault Identification**: Easy to identify faulty devices as each node actively participates in data transmission
- **Cable Requirement**: Requires less cabling compared to star topology when devices are arranged in a physical circle

**Disadvantages of Ring Topology**:

- **Single Point of Failure**: Failure of one device or cable can bring down the entire network
- **Difficult Troubleshooting**: Identifying the exact point of failure can be challenging
- **Complex Installation**: Adding or removing devices requires reconfiguring the network and disrupts operation
- **Latency Issues**: Data must pass through each node, potentially causing delays in large networks
- **Limited Flexibility**: Not easily adaptable to changing network requirements
- **Reconfiguration Complexity**: Network reconfiguration requires downtime and careful planning
- **Less Common Support**: Fewer modern networking devices support pure ring topology compared to star topology
