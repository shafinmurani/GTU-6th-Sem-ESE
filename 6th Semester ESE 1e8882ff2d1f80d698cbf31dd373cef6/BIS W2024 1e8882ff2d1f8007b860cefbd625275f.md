## Q.1(a) Define Security attacks and describe any two attacks in detail. (3 marks)

Security attacks are actions that compromise the security of information owned by an organization or individual.

**Two security attacks in detail:**

- **Passive Attacks**: Involve monitoring of transmissions without altering the data. The attacker only observes the transmission to gain information (e.g., eavesdropping, traffic analysis).
- **Active Attacks**: Involve modification of the data stream or creation of false data streams. Examples include masquerade attacks, replay attacks, and modification of messages.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Prevents legitimate users from accessing services by overwhelming resources or disrupting connections.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attack**: Attacker secretly relays and possibly alters communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.

## Q.1(b) Explain data confidentiality, data integrity and data availability in terms of security. (4 marks)

**Data Confidentiality:**

- Ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized individuals
- Prevents unauthorized disclosure of information
- Implemented through encryption, access controls, and authentication mechanisms
- Protects data from passive attacks like eavesdropping
- Maintains privacy of sensitive information
- Examples include encrypting stored data and communications

**Data Integrity:**

- Ensures data is accurate, complete, and unaltered during storage and transmission
- Detects any unauthorized modifications to information
- Implemented through checksums, hash functions, and digital signatures
- Protects against active attacks that attempt to modify data
- Ensures data reliability for decision-making processes

**Data Availability:**

- Ensures timely and reliable access to information and resources for authorized users
- Systems and networks should function properly when needed
- Implemented through redundancy, backup systems, and disaster recovery plans
- Guards against DoS attacks and system failures
- Measures include load balancing, failover systems, and robust infrastructure design

## Q.1(c) Describe the Rail fence method of cryptography with an example. (7 marks)

**Rail Fence Method (Zig-Zag Cipher):**

- A type of transposition cipher that derives its name from the way in which encryption is performed
- Involves writing the plaintext in a zig-zag pattern across multiple "rails" (rows) and then reading off the ciphertext row by row
- The key in this method is the number of rails (rows) used
- No substitution of characters takes place; only their positions are changed
- A simple yet effective technique for basic encryption needs
- The decryption process involves reconstructing the rail fence pattern
- Vulnerable to cryptanalysis with sufficient ciphertext

**Procedure:**

1. Write the message in a zig-zag pattern with a specified number of rails
2. Read the text row by row to get the ciphertext
3. To decrypt, create the pattern again and fill in characters in zig-zag order

**Example:**
Let's encrypt the message "INFORMATION SECURITY" using Rail Fence with 3 rails.

Step 1: Write the message in a zig-zag pattern with 3 rails:

```
Rail 1: I     A     S     Y
Rail 2:  N   M T   N E   R T
Rail 3:   F R   I O   C U I

```

Step 2: Read off the ciphertext row by row:
Ciphertext: "IASYnmtnertfriocui"

**Decryption process:**

1. Calculate the length of each rail based on message length and number of rails
2. Reconstruct the rail fence pattern with empty spaces
3. Fill the pattern with ciphertext letters row by row
4. Read the plaintext in a zig-zag pattern

## Q.1(c) OR Describe the One Time Pad method of cryptography with an example. (7 marks)

**One Time Pad Method:**

- Considered theoretically unbreakable if implemented correctly
- Uses a random key that is at least as long as the plaintext message
- Each key is used only once and then discarded (hence "one time")
- Involves a simple XOR or modular addition operation between plaintext and key
- Produces ciphertext that reveals no information about the plaintext without the key
- The key must be truly random and kept completely secret
- Requires secure distribution of the key to both sender and receiver
- Provides perfect secrecy but has practical limitations in key management

**Procedure:**

1. Generate a truly random key of the same length as the plaintext
2. Convert plaintext and key to numerical values (e.g., A=0, B=1, etc.)
3. Add plaintext and key values modulo 26 (for the English alphabet)
4. Convert the resulting values back to letters to get the ciphertext
5. To decrypt, subtract key values from ciphertext values modulo 26

**Example:**
Let's encrypt the message "HELLO" using a One Time Pad.

Step 1: Convert plaintext to numbers (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25)
HELLO → 7, 4, 11, 11, 14

Step 2: Generate a random key of the same length
Key: XMCKL → 23, 12, 2, 10, 11

Step 3: Add plaintext and key values modulo 26
(7+23)%26=30%26=4, (4+12)%26=16, (11+2)%26=13, (11+10)%26=21, (14+11)%26=25
Result: 4, 16, 13, 21, 25

Step 4: Convert the resulting numbers back to letters
4, 16, 13, 21, 25 → EQNVZ

Ciphertext: "EQNVZ"

**Decryption process:**

1. Convert ciphertext and key to numerical values
2. Subtract key values from ciphertext values modulo 26
3. Convert the resulting values back to letters to get the plaintext

## Q.2(a) Define Steganography and Describe any one type. (3 marks)

**Steganography:** The practice of concealing a message within another message or physical object to avoid detection.

**Text Steganography (one type):**

- Hides secret information within text documents
- Uses techniques like changing text formatting, spacing, or positions
- May use invisible characters or specific word patterns
- Often combined with encryption for additional security
- Difficult to detect because it manipulates seemingly innocent text
- Examples include using the first letter of each word/line to form a hidden message

## Q.2(b) Describe Caesar cipher with an example. (4 marks)

**Caesar Cipher:**

- One of the simplest and oldest known encryption techniques
- A type of substitution cipher where each letter is shifted a fixed number of places down the alphabet
- Named after Julius Caesar who used it for military communications
- The shift value (typically between 1-25) serves as the encryption key
- Easy to implement but offers minimal security by modern standards
- Can be broken easily using frequency analysis
- Forms the basis for more complex substitution ciphers

**Example with shift value of 3:**

- Original alphabet: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
- Shifted alphabet: DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC

To encrypt "HELLO":

- H → K (shift 3 positions)
- E → H (shift 3 positions)
- L → O (shift 3 positions)
- L → O (shift 3 positions)
- O → R (shift 3 positions)

Plaintext: HELLO

## Q.2(c) Draw the key matrix for the key: UNIVERSITY and find cipher text for the plain text: GUJARAT TECHNOLOGICAL using Play fair cipher. (7 marks)

**Step 1: Create the Playfair key matrix using "UNIVERSITY"**

- Remove duplicate letters: UNIVERSITY → UNIVERSTY
- Fill the 5×5 matrix with the key first, then the remaining alphabet (I/J are combined)

```
U N I V E
R S T Y A
B C D F G
H K L M O
P Q W X Z

```

**Step 2: Prepare the plaintext "GUJARAT TECHNOLOGICAL"**

- Split into digraphs (pairs of letters)
- Insert 'X' between double letters or at the end if needed
- Result: GU JA RA TT EC HN OL OG IC AL

Note: Since TT has a double letter, we modify to: GU JA RA TX TE CH NO LO GI CA L

**Step 3: Apply Playfair cipher rules**

1. If letters in a pair appear in same row, replace with letters to the right (wrapping around if needed)
2. If letters in a pair appear in same column, replace with letters below (wrapping around if needed)
3. If letters form a rectangle, replace with letters at the remaining corners of the rectangle

**Step 4: Encrypt each digraph**

- GU → GH (rectangle rule)
- JA → CA (rectangle rule)
- RA → YG (rectangle rule)
- TX → QZ (rectangle rule)
- TE → QI (rectangle rule)
- CH → BN (rectangle rule)
- NO → VO (rectangle rule)
- LO → MO (rectangle rule)
- GI → KI (rectangle rule)
- CA → BA (rectangle rule)
- L → LX (added X to complete the pair) → MP (rectangle rule)

## Q.2(b) OR Describe Mono alphabetic cipher with an example. (4 marks)

**Monoalphabetic Cipher:**

- A substitution cipher that uses a fixed substitution over the entire message
- Each letter of the plaintext is replaced by exactly one letter in the ciphertext
- The substitution is one-to-one and remains the same throughout the encryption
- The key is the substitution alphabet, which maps each plaintext letter to a ciphertext letter
- More secure than Caesar cipher but still vulnerable to frequency analysis
- There are 26! (factorial) possible substitution alphabets for English
- Can be broken using statistical analysis of letter frequencies

**Example:**

- Create a substitution mapping (key):
    - Original alphabet: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    - Substitution alphabet: QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM
- To encrypt "HELLO":
    - H → G (in the substitution alphabet)
    - E → T (in the substitution alphabet)

## Q.2(c) OR Draw the key matrix for the key: GUJ and find cipher text for the plain text: HINDUSTAN using Hill cipher. (7 marks)

**Step 1: Create the Hill cipher key matrix for "GUJ"**
First, convert GUJ to numerical values (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25):
G → 6, U → 20, J → 9

For a 3×1 plaintext, we need a 3×3 matrix. But we only have 3 letters, so we'll use the 3 letters to create a 2×2 matrix:

```
G U  →  6  20
J 1     9   1

```

(Using 1 for the missing value)

**Step 2: Prepare the plaintext "HINDUSTAN"**
Convert to numerical values:
H → 7, I → 8, N → 13, D → 3, U → 20, S → 18, T → 19, A → 0, N → 13

Divide into pairs: HI, ND, US, TA, N (add padding X if needed)
So, it becomes: HI, ND, US, TA, NX

NX where X is padding, with X=23
7,8 | 13,3 | 20,18 | 19,0 | 13,23

**Step 3: Multiply each pair by the key matrix (mod 26)**

For HI (7,8):

```
[6  20] × [7] = [6×7 + 20×8] = [42 + 160] = [202] = [20] (mod 26)
[9   1]   [8]   [9×7 + 1×8]    [63 + 8]    [71]   [19]

```

For ND (13,3):

```
[6  20] × [13] = [6×13 + 20×3] = [78 + 60] = [138] = [8] (mod 26)
[9   1]    [3]   [9×13 + 1×3]    [117 + 3]  [120]  [16]

```

For US (20,18):

```
[6  20] × [20] = [6×20 + 20×18] = [120 + 360] = [480] = [14] (mod 26)
[9   1]    [18]  [9×20 + 1×18]    [180 + 18]   [198]  [16]

```

For TA (19,0):

```
[6  20] × [19] = [6×19 + 20×0] = [114 + 0] = [114] = [10] (mod 26)
[9   1]    [0]   [9×19 + 1×0]    [171 + 0]  [171]  [15]

```

For NX (13,23):

```
[6  20] × [13] = [6×13 + 20×23] = [78 + 460] = [538] = [18] (mod 26)
[9   1]    [23]  [9×13 + 1×23]    [117 + 23]  [140]  [10]

```

**Step 4: Convert the resulting numbers back to letters**
20,19 → UT
8,16 → IQ
14,16 → OQ
10,15 → KP
18,10 → SJ

- Named after its inventors: Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman
- Widely used for secure data transmission and digital signatures
- Slower than symmetric algorithms but provides key management advantages
- Used in hybrid encryption systems where RSA securely exchanges symmetric keys

**RSA Key Generation Procedure:**

1. Choose two large prime numbers p and q
2. Calculate n = p × q
3. Calculate φ(n) = (p-1) × (q-1)
4. Choose an integer e such that 1 < e < φ(n) and gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1
5. Calculate d such that d × e ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))
6. Public key is (e, n) and private key is (d, n)

**Encryption:**
For a message M where M < n:
Ciphertext C = M^e mod n

**Decryption:**
To decrypt ciphertext C:
Message M = C^d mod n

**Example:**

1. Choose p = 3 and q = 11
2. Calculate n = p × q = 3 × 11 = 33
3. Calculate φ(n) = (p-1) × (q-1) = 2 × 10 = 20
4. Choose e = 7 (relatively prime to 20)
5. Calculate d where (d × 7) mod 20 = 1, so d = 3
6. Public key is (7, 33), private key is (3, 33)

For message M = 2:
Encryption: C = 2^7 mod 33 = 128 mod 33 = 29
Decryption: M = 29^3 mod 33 = 24389 mod 33 = 2

## Q.5(c) OR Describe IP Spoofing, ARP spoofing and Session Hijacking in detail. (7 marks)

**IP Spoofing:**

- A technique where attackers falsify the source IP address in packet headers
- Creates packets that appear to come from trusted or legitimate sources
- Used to hide the attacker's identity and evade detection
- Enables attacks like DDoS by making traffic appear from multiple sources
- Can bypass IP-based authentication systems and access controls
- Often used as part of more complex attack strategies
- Preventable through ingress/egress filtering and authentication mechanisms
- Real-world examples include DNS amplification attacks
- Particularly dangerous in networks without proper source validation
- Modern networks employ RPF (Reverse Path Forwarding) to detect spoofed packets

**ARP Spoofing:**

- Attack that exploits weaknesses in the Address Resolution Protocol
- Attacker sends falsified ARP messages over a local network
- Links attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate host
- Creates a "man-in-the-middle" position for the attacker
- Traffic meant for the legitimate host is redirected to the attacker
- Enables eavesdropping, session hijacking, and connection interception
- Only works on local networks (broadcast domains)
- Can be used to steal sensitive information or modify data in transit
- Preventive measures include static ARP entries and ARP monitoring tools
- Modern switches may include ARP inspection features to prevent this attack

**Session Hijacking:**

- The exploitation and takeover of a valid computer session
- Attacker steals the session identifier to impersonate the legitimate user
- Bypasses authentication processes since the session is already established
- Types include network-level, application-level, and client-side hijacking
- Usually performed through session token theft or prediction
- Methods include packet sniffing, cross-site scripting, and man-in-the-browser attacks
- Most dangerous on unencrypted connections without session verification
- Can lead to unauthorized transactions or data access with victim's privileges
- Preventive measures include using HTTPS, secure cookies, and session timeouts
- Modern web applications implement token refreshing and IP validation
