## A Few Honest Notes

- These solutions are meant as a **helpful reference**, not a guarantee of full marks.
- Theyâ€™re written by a student (me!) and may not be perfect-always double-check and try to really understand the concepts.
- Use them to learn, not just to copy. The real win is when you can explain it to someone else!
